# Project Title

World Saviors

## Background

A group of scientists have found the formula to foreshadow the date society will collapse. After many years of analysis, they have concluded the formular is based on three sole factors: The number of followers of Kylie Jenner, the supporters of Donald Trump, and the number of UFO sightings in the last 365 days. However they have come to another conclusion: Good deeds make a difference. Anonymous actions such as helping a blind person cross the street, reading a book, or rescuing a cat from a tree can make the tables turn.
